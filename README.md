# Film Quote

## Introduction
- This project uses Jetpack Compose to build a simple Android app, which displays a film quote and title on the screen, and a clickable button.
- Building this app was a challenge in Makers Module 3 - Mobile Applications: Android applications.

## Objectives
- [x] Create a new Android application "Film Quote" which shows your favourite film quote, and the name of the film from which it is quoted.
- [x] You should use a different font size for the quote itself, and for the movie name.
- [x] Ideally, use three different @Composable functions â€” one of the quote, one for the film name, and one for the overall screen.
- [x] Play around with modifiers for alignment, paddings, font size, and even colours. 
- [x] Add a button to the film quote app you've created earlier. This button shouldn't do anything for now, just use println() to log something.
- [x] Make sure the user-facing strings, like the film quote, film name, and button labels, are defined in strings.xml and imported using the R class. Below is an example result you can get:
