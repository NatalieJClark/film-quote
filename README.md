## Objectives
- [x] Create a new Android application "Film Quote" which shows your favourite film quote, and the name of the film from which it is quoted.
- [x] You should use a different font size for the quote itself, and for the movie name.
- [x] Ideally, use three different @Composable functions â€” one of the quote, one for the film name, and one for the overall screen.
- [x] Play around with modifiers for alignment, paddings, font size, and even colours. Below is an example screen you can end up with.
